## Quick Startup Guide ##
### Install Python and dependent packages ###
You need Python 3.6.5 (Python 2.7 support is deprecated) to run this toolbox. For an easy installation process, we recommend Anaconda since it will reliably install all the necessary dependencies. Download [Anaconda](http://continuum.io/downloads) and follow the instructions on the [installation page](http://docs.continuum.io/anaconda/install).   Once you have Python, you can then install the toolbox.

### Get the Quant Quest Toolbox ###
There are multiple ways to install the toolbox for the competition.

The easiest way and the most recommended way is via pip. Just run the following command:
`pip install -U auquan_toolbox`
If we publish any updates to the toolbox, the same command `pip install -U auquan_toolbox` will also automatically get the new version of the toolbox.

**Note**: Mac users, if you face any issues with installation, try using 'pip install --user auquan_toolbox'
